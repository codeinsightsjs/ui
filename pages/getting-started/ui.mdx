# Visualizing Data

The ultimate goal of CodeInsights is to provide an assortment of visual and data-based tools that can help you navigate through your codebase in two significant ways:

* Bird's Eye View - This gives you an understanding of your codebase's general health and state.
* Detailed Analysis - This allows for pinpointing specific areas of concern within individual files, functions, or lines of code.

In order to do that, you can do it in one of three ways:

## Centralized Logging Platform

The fastest and easiest way to visualize your data is to send the output result to a logging platform.

OpenSearch allows you to both explore your data, and create visualizations and dashboards. Paid platforms like Coralogix, DataDog and Splunk offer similiar capabilities.

## Running OpenSearch

The CodeInsights library comes ready with a `docker-compose` file, containing both OpenSearch and OpenSearch dashboards.

Clone the repository, and run the following command to run it:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Custom UI
You can create your own UI to visualize the data that CodeInsights provides.
A plugin that can help do that, is the `ChartJSPlugin`, which generates Charts from all the data that CodeInsights provides.

The [code](https://github.com/codeinsightsorg/docs/tree/main/pages/explore) of the [explore](/explore) page is an example of how to use the `ChartJSPlugin` to generate charts.

The downside in this approach is the amount of work needed to create a custom UI.

This is why we are working on a UI that will be available out of the box, that will allow you to easily integrate your repo and visualize your data.

## CodeInsights UI (Coming ~July 2023)

The CodeInsights UI will allow you to easily integrate your repo and visualize your data, with ready visualizations and data-tables.

You will be able to upload the output of CodeInsights to the UI, or run it on your own infrastructure and update it with each build.
