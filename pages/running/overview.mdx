# Overview

There are three methods for executing CodeInsights: via command line, by using a configuration file within an existing repository, or through NodeJS integration.

The ideal method depends on your specific requirements.

* To run CodeInsights for a designated repository, a [custom configuration file](./configuration) in that repo is the optimal approach.
* For a quick exploration or CI, the [command line interface (CLI)](./cli) is the most efficient choice.
* For integration with your own code, utilizing the [NodeJS library](./library) is the best solution.
