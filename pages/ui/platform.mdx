# Centralized Logging Platform

The fastest and easiest way to visualize your data is to send the output result to a logging platform.

OpenSearch allows you to both explore your data, and create visualizations and dashboards. Paid platforms like Coralogix, DataDog and Splunk offer similiar capabilities.

### Running OpenSearch

The CodeInsights library comes ready with a `docker-compose` file, containing both OpenSearch and OpenSearch dashboards.

Clone the repository, and run the following command to run it:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then use the [OpenSearch](/plugins/post-processors/coralogix) plugin.

### Sending Data to a Vendor

You can send the data to a logging vendor by creating a custom post-processor plugin, or by using the existing built in ones.

Right now we support the following vendors:
* [Coralogix](/plugins/post-processors/coralogix)

Make sure to go over the documentation of the plugin you are using to understand how to configure it.
