# Centralized Logging Platform

The fastest and easiest way to visualize your data is to send the output result to a logging platform.

OpenSearch allows you to both explore your data, and create visualizations and dashboards. Paid platforms like Coralogix, DataDog and Splunk offer similiar capabilities.

### Running OpenSearch

The CodeInsights library comes ready with a `docker-compose` file, containing both OpenSearch and OpenSearch dashboards.

Clone the repository, and run the following command to run it:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
