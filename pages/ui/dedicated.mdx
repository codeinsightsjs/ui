# Dedicated UI (Coming ~July 2023)

The CodeInsights UI will allow you to easily integrate your repo and visualize your data, with ready visualizations and data-tables.

You will be able to upload the output of CodeInsights to the UI, or run it on your own infrastructure and update it with each build.
