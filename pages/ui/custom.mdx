# Custom UI

You can create your own UI to visualize the data that CodeInsights provides.
A plugin that can help do that, is the `ChartJSPlugin`, which generates Charts from all the data that CodeInsights provides.

The [code](https://github.com/codeinsightsorg/docs/tree/main/pages/explore) of the [explore](/explore) page is an example of how to use the `ChartJSPlugin` to generate charts.

The downside in this approach is the amount of work needed to create a custom UI.

This is why we are working on a UI that will be available out of the box, that will allow you to easily integrate your repo and visualize your data.
