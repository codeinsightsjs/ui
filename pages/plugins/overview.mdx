# Plugins Overview

CodeInsights is designed around a versatile plugin system that not only allows you to utilize the built-in plugins but also enables you to [create your own](./plugins/custom).

There are two primary categories of plugins:

1. [**Analyzers**](./analyzer) - These plugins are used to analyze files in your repository and derive insights from them.
2. [**Post-Processors**](./post-processors) - These plugins are responsible for processing the final results, such as sending them to a logging system or generating visual representations like charts.
