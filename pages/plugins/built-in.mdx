# Built-In Plugins

CodeInsightsJS comes with a set of plugins that are added by default which work well for JS/TS projects.

However, if you wish to have a different setup you can always add your own plugins, or remove the built-in ones by setting `useDefaultPlugins` to `false`.

## Usage

To use a built-in plugin, simply add the path to the plugin to the `plugins` array in the [configuration](../getting-started/configuration) file.

## Analyzer Plugins

These are plugins that are used to analyze the code, and work on processing each and every file in the codebase.

| Name          | Description       | Path | Is Used By Default
|---------------|------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------
| ImportsPlugin | Information about all the imports (importedFrom, and imported)   | `plugins/imports.ts`          | x          |
| TSFilePlugin      | Get information about functions and files     | `plugins/ts-file.ts`          | x
| HTMLTagsPlugin      | Get all used tags     | `plugins/used-html-tags.ts`          | x
| AngularPlugin      | Count the number of components     | `plugins/angular.ts`          |

## Post-Processors Plugins

These plugins are used as post-processors, and work on the entire result of the analysis.

| Name          | Description       | Path | Is Used By Default
|---------------|------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------
| ChartJSPlugin | Generate ChartJS graphs, based on the count of labels, as well as combination of labels and metrics   | `plugins/chartjs-plugin.ts`          | x          |
| ConsoleLogPlugin | Output result to console log   | `plugins/console-log-finalizer.ts`          |           |
| CoralogixFinalizer | Send the entire result to Coralogix   | `plugins/coralogix-finalizer.ts`          |      |
| OpenSearchFinalizer | Send the entire result to OpenSearch   | `plugins/coralogix-finalizer.ts`          |      |
