# Using a Plugin

The way to use a plugin will depend on how you choose to run CodeInsights. (See more info at [Running CodeInsights](/running/overview)

The main steps are:
1. **Include the plugin id or path** - built-in plugins can be used with their ids. For custom plugins, you can use the path to the plugin file.
2. **Configure the plugin** - Some plugins can be used out of the box, and some require configuration via parameters or environment variables. See the documentation page for the plugin you want to use for more information.
