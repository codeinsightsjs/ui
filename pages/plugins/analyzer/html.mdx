# HTML Plugin

The HTML Plugin provides information about all the tags in your HTML files. It can be used
to detect which tags are the most common in your application.

A common use case is for component libraries, if your components all start with a prefix, for example `mat-` you can filter
the plugin to gather information only about those, then use the result to detect which components are the most
used in your application.

## Plugin Details

This plugin extracts information about JavaScript and TypeScript files, and functions. It can be used to visualize
the lines of code in your functions or files.
